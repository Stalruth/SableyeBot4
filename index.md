# Sableye Bot

[Invite this bot to your server!][invite]

Competitive Pokémon Discord Bot.  Features accurate data for every Pokémon
game from Red and Blue to Sword and Shield.

Slash commands are currently being trialled in a limited selection of servers
and will be rolled out to all servers after some improvements are made to
Discord.

## Features

Sableye Bot has a wide range of commands to recall data relevant to
competitive Pokémon.  For example:

### Data Lookup

The `/dt`/`//dt` command allows the user to obtain information on any Move, Item,
Ability, Pokemon, or Nature in the game.  The `gen` parameter can be used to
look up data from previous generations.

### Pokémon Filter

The `/filter`/`//filter` command offers a wide range of search parameters that allow you
to find the perfect Pokémon, including filtering by Type, Ability or Move.

### Coverage Checker

The `/coverage`/`//coverage` command allows you to check coverage based either on a
Pokémon's STAB or the Types of its attacks.

### Weakness Checker

The `/weakness`/`//weakness` command shows you the weaknesses of the Pokémon or types
provided.

### Autocomplete

Where possible, all Slash Commands have Autocomplete enabled to guide you in
filling out the parameters so that you aren't left in the dark.
