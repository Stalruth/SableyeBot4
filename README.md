# SableyeBot 4

Competitive Pokémon Discord Bot, rewritten from the ground up.

This software is in alpha, and just like an alpha male may be unstable.
Proceed with caution.

## Privacy

dude i haven't even implemented logging yet maybe chill tf out

SableyeBot4 doesn't currently retain any data in the course of its
usage.

This will probably change, primarily for the purposes of logging
executed commands (with no context as to who executed the command).

## Installation
`discord.js@13.0.0` (and therefore SableyeBot 4) requires NodeJS v16.6.

Follow these steps to run your own local copy:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Rename `example.env` to `.env` and fill out the fields needed.
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` and you're off to the races!

And not nearly as soul crushing as SabelyeBot 3!

## Issues

Alpha software has bugs.  Fact of life.  If you find a bug, please
include the following in your [complaint][hatemail]:

- A description of the bug (What should have happened! What did happen!)
- Reproduction steps (This usually means paste out the commands you
  used, including arguments)
- Screenshots/Pastes of output, GIFs if necessary.
- Bot version (`/about` has this info)
- Any other additional information you think might be useful.

## Contributing

If you can help me out I'm always open to pull requests.  Don't worry
about styling - as long as your code is prettier than a dumpster fire
I'll fuss over the specifics myself.
